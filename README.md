# Form for daily schedule as time blocks

The file `main.pdf` contains a two-page form. 
- Enter planned activities in the leftmost column.
- When an interruption occurs or time spent on one activity is extended, add the extension in the next column to the right and enter the revised schedule below it.
- If you need more than three revised schedules, you have a time management problem!

The PDF was generated from the `main.tex` file with LaTeX.
Edited the `main.tex` file to suit your own schedule.
The form spares you of the need to pack around a ruler all day.
